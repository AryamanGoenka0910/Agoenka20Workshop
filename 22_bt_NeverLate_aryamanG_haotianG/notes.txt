Notes on Bootstrap:
- CSS and JS on basically every html element
- Breakpoints: Control your layout to be adapted at a particular viewport or device size
- .cointainer-fluid for width 100% across all viewports
- An html element can be given multiple classes by seperating them with a space within the same quotations.
    - (i.e. <a class="class0 class1"></a>)
- flex - layout and alignment of divs
