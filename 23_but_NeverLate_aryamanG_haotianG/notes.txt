DISCO:
- Foundation uses javascript, just like Bootstrap
- Foundation and Bootstrap both have plugin functionality and can be customized if you download and compile their SASS files

QCC:
- Grid tables in foundation and bootstrap both have 12 columns
- Why are there no padding or margin utilities in foundation?
- Is using the word "grid" for flexbox confusing since grids and flexbox are different things that exist in css?

Q0:
- We looked through the foundation documentation for an more in-depth understanding of cards, accordions, callouts, and flexbox utilities
- We didn't need to look through the docs, but we wanted to see some other aspects of foundation

Q1:
- We prefer using Bootstrap since it provides more out of the box functionality, such as padding/margin classes
